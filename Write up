For our project we decided that we would create a program that will allow the user to have the option to add a class, drop a class, or list the courses. The project is broken down into two python modules. One called Menu and the other called course manager. 

The Menu module is a Text-based user interface that is built within a While True loop that repeats its options until the user decides to break out of the loop. The module offers the user a choice to add a course if they press one, drop a course if they pick two, list the courses if they pick three and exit the program if they pick four. Each function of the code processes the respective requirement by importing a specific function from the course manager based on the userâ€™s choice. This approach ensures modular and efficient handling of the course management tasks. It also has a condition statement that will display a error if the user enters a wrong input. This way the user will know that they need to change what they enter.

The Course Manager module encapsulates each function for managing courses. These functionalities include add_course, drop_course and list_course. The add_course function allows the user to add courses to a set. It also checks for duplicates and will notify the user if they are already in the course. The drop course function facilitates the removal of each course in the set, by checking to see if the course is in the set and removing it if it is. And last but not least the list_courses. The list_course function displays the current set of courses and presents an error message if the set is empty.
